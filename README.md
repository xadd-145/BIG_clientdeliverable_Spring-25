## üè¢ Set up instructions 

**Step 1: Upload Project Files**
Begin by uploading the required backend source code files to your local system or server. The raw text data file used to train the chatbot and app.py file, which contains the Streamlit-based GUI code for the chatbot interface.

**Step 2: Run the Chatbot Code**
Open your code editor and run the chatbot code.

**Step 3: Host the Chatbot on Streamlit**
Once executed, Streamlit will host the chatbot locally or on your cloud environment.

**Step 4: Integrate with Figma Website Prototype**
Copy the generated Streamlit link and open the Figma website prototype. Then use the Figma embed feature or link placeholder component to integrate the chatbot link within the prototype. Ensure the chatbot is embedded within the desired section or wherever required in the pilot-facing interface.

**Step 5: Test the Final Functional Prototype**
Run or preview the Figma prototype. You should now be able to, Interact with the static website UI. Access the working chatbot directly from the prototype, enabling end-to-end demonstration and functionality¬†testing.
